The force that the heart must contract against to pump blood into the systemic circulation,Afterload 
The stretch on the heart prior to contraction,Preload
The force and rate that the heart beats with,Contractility
Contractility is determined by,Myocyte calcium levels
The most posterior chamber of the heart,Left atrium
The most anterior chamber of the heart,Right ventricle 
The P wave on an ECG represents,Atrial depolarization
The QRS complex on an ECG represent,Ventricular depolarization 
The T wave on an ECG represents,Ventricular repolarization 
Electrical conduction in the heart is slowest through which node?,Atrioventricular Node 
Conduction through the AV node is represented on an ECG as,The PR interval 
A slowed heart rate (i.e.: regularly below 60 BPM in the adult) is called,Bradycardia

A 49-year-old man presents to the emergency department with palpatations. He has felt fatigued all day and the feeling got worse after drinking alcohol. The animation represents the patient's cardiac activity. Which of the following ECG strips best fits the patient's arrhythmia?,AFib,Correct. The ECG shows indistinct P waves with QRS complexes at irregular intervals.  Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.,AFib,AFL,AVNRT
A 60-year-old woman presents to her physician feeling lightheaded and like her heart is racing. Patient history is significant for atrial fibrillation for which she is currently taking the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The animation represents the patient's cardiac activity. Which of the following ECG strips best fits the patient's arrhythmia?,Flutter,Correct.  The ECG demonstrates the sawtooth pattern with 2:1 conduction. The proarrhythmia effects of the drug have induced atrial flutter.,AFib,Flutter,AVNRT
A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department with palpitations  and a pulsing sensation in his neck. The patient recalls exercising just prior to the onset of symptoms. The animation represents the patient's cardiac activity. Which of the following ECG strips best fits the patient's arrhythmia?,AVNRT,Correct.  The ECG reflects AVNRT. Notice the tachycardia and retrograde P waves (upward deflections) after the QRS complex (large downward deflections). The pulsing sensation in the neck results from the atria contracting against a closed tricuspid valve because the atria and ventricles can contract nearly simultaneously.,AFib,AFL,AVNRT
